He warned of the perils ahead, ending his note, “in the name of God, let Palestine be left alone.” Thus Rashid Khalidi, al-Khalidi’s great-great-nephew, begins this sweeping history, the first general account of the conflict told from an explicitly Palestinian perspective. Drawing on a wealth of untapped archival materials and the reports of generations of family members—mayors, judges, scholars, diplomats, and journalists—The Hundred Years' War on Palestine upends accepted interpretations of the conflict, which tend, at best, to describe a tragic clash between two peoples with claims to the same territory. Instead, Khalidi traces a hundred years of colonial war on the Palestinians, waged first by the Zionist movement and then Israel, but backed by Britain and the United States, the great powers of the age. He highlights the key episodes in this colonial campaign, from the 1917 Balfour Declaration to the destruction of Palestine in 1948, from Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon to the endless and futile peace process. Original, authoritative, and important, The Hundred Years' War on Palestine is not a chronicle of victimization, nor does it whitewash the mistakes of Palestinian leaders or deny the emergence of national movements on both sides. In reevaluating the forces arrayed against the Palestinians, it offers an illuminating new view of a conflict that continues to this day.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781627798549"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1627798544"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":218,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.15.14.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xXlwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xXlwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=xXlwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+hundred+years&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xXlwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xXlwDwAAQBAJ","status":"Done","rating":9},{"title":"The Jakarta Method","subtitle":"Washington's Anticommunist Crusade and the Mass Murder Program that Shaped Our World","authors":["Vincent Bevins"],"publisher":"PublicAffairs","publishedDate":"2020-05-19","description":"NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR, THE FINANCIAL TIMES, AND GQ “A radical new history of the United States abroad” (Wall Street Journal) which uncovers U.S. complicity in the mass-killings of left-wing activists in Indonesia, Latin America and around the world In 1965, the U.S. government helped the Indonesian military kill approximately one million innocent civilians. This was one of the most important turning points of the twentieth century, eliminating the largest communist party outside China and the Soviet Union and inspiring copycat terror programs in faraway countries like Brazil and Chile. But these events remain widely overlooked, precisely because the CIA's secret interventions were so successful. In this bold and comprehensive new history, Vincent Bevins builds on his incisive reporting for the Washington Post, using recently declassified documents, archival research and eye-witness testimony collected across twelve countries to reveal a shocking legacy that spans the globe. For decades, it's been believed that parts of the developing world passed peacefully into the U.S.-led capitalist system. The Jakarta Method demonstrates that the brutal extermination of unarmed leftists was a fundamental part of Washington's final triumph in the Cold War.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781541724013"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1541724011"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":362,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Political Science"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.10.9.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ifusDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ifusDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=ifusDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+jakarta+method&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ifusDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ifusDwAAQBAJ","status":"Done","rating":9},{"title":"1984","authors":["George Orwell"],"publisher":"HarperCollins","publishedDate":"2013-09-03","description":"75th ANNIVERSARY EDITION “Orwell saw, to his credit, that the act of falsifying reality is only secondarily a way of changing perceptions. It is, above all, a way of asserting power.”—The New Yorker In 1984, London is a grim city in the totalitarian state of Oceania where Big Brother is always watching you and the Thought Police can practically read your mind. Winston Smith is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be. Lionel Trilling said of Orwell’s masterpiece, “1984 is a profound, terrifying, and wholly fascinating book. It is a fantasy of the political future, and like any such fantasy, serves its author as a magnifying device for an examination of the present.” Though the year 1984 now exists in the past, Orwell’s novel remains an urgent call for the individual willing to speak truth to power.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780547249643"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0547249640"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":309,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":82,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"3.33.29.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=1984&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kotPYEqx7kMC","status":"Done","rating":9},{"title":"Frankenstein","authors":["Mary Shelley"],"publisher":"Independently Published","publishedDate":"2020-01-04","description":"A monster assembled by a scientist from parts of dead bodies develops a mind of his own as he learns to loathe himself and hate his creator.

The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society’s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within.

Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied—and too glorious to surrender.

For the left and the right, major multinational companies are held up as the ultimate expressions of free-market capitalism. Their remarkable success appears to vindicate the old idea that modern society is too complex to be subjected to a plan. And yet, as Leigh Phillips and Michal Rozworski argue, much of the economy of the West is centrally planned at present. Not only is planning on vast scales possible, we already have it and it works. The real question is whether planning can be democratic. Can it be transformed to work for us? An engaging, polemical romp through economic theory, computational complexity, and the history of planning, The People’s Republic of Walmart revives the conversation about how society can extend democratic decision-making to all economic matters. With the advances in information technology in recent decades and the emergence of globe-straddling collective enterprises, democratic planning in the interest of all humanity is more important and closer to attainment than ever before.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781786635167"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"178663516X"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":257,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Political Science"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.1.3.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IcCGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IcCGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=IcCGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&dq=the+people+walmart&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=IcCGDwAAQBAJ&dq=the+people+walmart&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_People_s_Republic_of_Walmart.html?hl=&id=IcCGDwAAQBAJ","status":"Done","rating":8},{"title":"Modern Monetary Theory","subtitle":"Bill and Warren's Excellent Adventure","authors":["William Mitchell","Warren Mosler"],"publisher":"Lola Books","publishedDate":"2024-07-17","description":"In this book, William Mitchell and Warren Mosler, original proponents of what's come to be known as Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), discuss their perspectives about how MMT has evolved over the last 30 years.

Part of the Macmillan Collector’s Library, a series of stunning, clothbound, pocket-sized classics with gold-foiled edges and ribbon markers. These beautiful books make perfect gifts or a treat for any book lover. This edition is translated from German by Douglas Scott and Chris Waller, and features an afterword by David Stuart Davies. On the morning of his thirtieth birthday, a young bank official named Joseph K is arrested although he has done nothing wrong and is never told what he’s been charged with. The Trial is the chronicle of his fight to prove his innocence, of his struggles and encounters with the invisible Law and the untouchable Court where he must make regular visits. It is an account, ultimately, of state-induced self-destruction presenting in a nightmarish scenario the persecution of the outsider and the incomprehensible machinations of the state.

Told through the eyes of Tish, a nineteen-year-old girl, in love with Fonny, a young sculptor who is the father of her child, Baldwin's story mixes the sweet and the sad. Tish and Fonny have pledged to get married, but Fonny is falsely accused of a terrible crime and imprisoned. Their families set out to clear his name, and as they face an uncertain future, the young lovers experience a kaleidoscope of emotions--affection, despair, and hope. In a love story that evokes the blues, where passion and sadness are inevitably intertwined, Baldwin has created two characters so alive and profoundly realized that they are unforgettably ingrained in the American psyche.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780593688984"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0593688988"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":225,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.1.1.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OcrxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OcrxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=OcrxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=if+beale&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=OcrxEAAAQBAJ&dq=if+beale&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/If_Beale_Street_Could_Talk_Deluxe_Editio.html?hl=&id=OcrxEAAAQBAJ","status":"Done","rating":7.5},{"title":"The Stranger","authors":["Albert Camus"],"publisher":"Vintage","publishedDate":"2012-08-08","description":"With the intrigue of a psychological thriller, The Stranger—Camus's masterpiece—gives us the story of an ordinary man unwittingly drawn into a senseless murder on an Algerian beach.

Abbott was first published in 1884, and for more than 100 years has continued to charm readers. A masterpiece of science fiction, it is in actuality a social commentary told through a mathematical framework offering pointed observations on the social hierarchy of Victorian culture. Abbott recounts the journeys of A. Square, a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women, represented by thin, straight lines are the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status. Through unusual occurrences, A. Square, has his perspective transformed forever as he comes into contact with a host of geometric forms, including those of one dimension in Lineland, three dimensions in Spaceland, and no dimensions in Pointland. He is returned to his two-dimensional world after he entertains a revolutionary idea of visiting a land of four dimensions. Flatland is not only fascinating book, but it is also a first-rate fictional introduction to the concept of the multiple dimensions of space. Einstein’s 1915 publication of the theory of relativity made Flatland popular as a prophet of four dimensions. It is still popular today amongst mathematics, physics, and computer science students. This brilliantly eccentric classic is an invitation to see beyond our own reality and influenced writers from Carl Sagan to Stephen Hawking.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781722524661"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1722524669"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":84,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.1.1.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LkSHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LkSHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=LkSHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=flatland&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LkSHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LkSHEAAAQBAJ","status":"Done","rating":7.5},{"title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","authors":["Gabriel Garcia Marquez"],"publisher":"Penguin UK","publishedDate":"2014-03-06","description":"ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS BOOKS AND WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE _______________________________ 'Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice' Gabriel García Márquez's great masterpiece is the story of seven generations of the Buendía family and of Macondo, the town they built.

Three thousand years ago on a battlefield in ancient Palestine, a shepherd boy felled a mighty warrior with nothing more than a stone and a sling, and ever since then the names of David and Goliath have stood for battles between underdogs and giants. David's victory was improbable and miraculous. He shouldn't have won. Or should he have? In David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell challenges how we think about obstacles and disadvantages, offering a new interpretation of what it means to be discriminated against, or cope with a disability, or lose a parent, or attend a mediocre school, or suffer from any number of other apparent setbacks. Gladwell begins with the real story of what happened between the giant and the shepherd boy those many years ago. From there, David and Goliath examines Northern Ireland's Troubles, the minds of cancer researchers and civil rights leaders, murder and the high costs of revenge, and the dynamics of successful and unsuccessful classrooms---all to demonstrate how much of what is beautiful and important in the world arises from what looks like suffering and adversity. In the tradition of Gladwell's previous bestsellers---The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers and What the Dog Saw---David and Goliath draws upon history, psychology, and powerful storytelling to reshape the way we think of the world around us.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0316239852"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780316239851"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":528,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Psychology"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jElklwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jElklwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=jElklwEACAAJ&dq=david+and+golia&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=jElklwEACAAJ&dq=david+and+golia&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/David_and_Goliath.html?hl=&id=jElklwEACAAJ","status":"Done","rating":6},{"title":"The Republic (Hero Classics)","authors":["Plato"],"publisher":"Legend Press Ltd","publishedDate":"2022-05-16","description":"The Republic, a pioneering work of political philosophy, is a dialogue that does not feature Plato directly as at the heart is Socrates – his teacher.

This landmark work continues to be one of the most well-known and influential explorations of moral and ethical philosophy ever conceived. Expanding on the concepts from his previous work Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche adopts a polemic approach to past philosophers who, in his view, lacked critical sense in accepting flawed premises in their consideration of morality. The metaphysics of morality, Nietzsche argues, should not assume that a good man is simply the opposite of an evil man, rather merely different expression of humanity’s common basic impulses. Controversial in its time, as well as hotly debated in the present, Nietzsche’s work moves beyond conventional ethics to suggest that a universal morality for all human beings in non-existent – perception, reason and experience are not static, but change according to an individual’s perspective and interpretation. The work further argues that philosophic traditions such as “truth,” “self-consciousness” and “free will” are merely inventions of Western morality and that the “will to power” is the real driving force of all human behaviour. This volume: Critiques the belief that actions, including domination or injury to the weak, can be universally objectionable Explores themes of religion and “master and slave” morality Includes a collection of stunning aphorisms and observations of the human condition Part of the bestselling Capstone Classics Series edited by Tom Butler-Bowdon,this collectible, hard-back edition of Beyond Good and Evil provides an accessible and insightful Introduction by leading Nietzsche authority Dr Christopher Janaway.

The discrepancies between this model and the reality it claims to address are then attributed to particular imperfections in reality itself. Most heterodox economists seize on this fact and insist that the world is characterized by imperfect competition. But this only ties them to the notion of perfect competition, which remains as their point of departure and base of comparison. There is no imperfection without perfection. In Capitalism, Anwar Shaikh takes a different approach. He demonstrates that most of the central propositions of economic analysis can be derived without any reference to standard devices such as hyperrationality, optimization, perfect competition, perfect information, representative agents, or so-called rational expectations. This perspective allows him to look afresh at virtually all the elements of economic analysis: the laws of demand and supply, the determination of wage and profit rates, technological change, relative prices, interest rates, bond and equity prices, exchange rates, terms and balance of trade, growth, unemployment, inflation, and long booms culminating in recurrent general crises. In every case, Shaikh's innovative theory is applied to modern empirical patterns and contrasted with neoclassical, Keynesian, and Post-Keynesian approaches to the same issues. Shaikh's object of analysis is the economics of capitalism, and he explores the subject in this expansive light. This is how the classical economists, as well as Keynes and Kalecki, approached the issue. Anyone interested in capitalism and economics in general can gain a wealth of knowledge from this ground-breaking text.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780190298340"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0190298340"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":1019,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"4.5.6.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0VxeCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0VxeCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=0VxeCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=anwar+shaik&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0VxeCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0VxeCwAAQBAJ","status":"Important","rating":0},{"title":"Molecular Feminisms","subtitle":"Biology, Becomings, and Life in the Lab","authors":["Deboleena Roy"],"publisher":"University of Washington Press","publishedDate":"2018-11-10","description":"�Should feminists clone?� �What do neurons think about?� �How can we learn from bacterial writing?� These provocative questions have haunted neuroscientist and molecular biologist Deboleena Roy since her early days of research when she was conducting experiments on an in vitro cell line using molecular biology techniques. An expert natural scientist as well as an intrepid feminist theorist, Roy takes seriously the expressive capabilities of biological �objects��such as bacteria and other human, nonhuman, organic, and inorganic actants�in order to better understand processes of becoming. She also suggests that renewed interest in matter and materiality in feminist theory must be accompanied by new feminist approaches that work with the everyday, nitty-gritty research methods and techniques in the natural sciences. By practicing science as feminism at the lab bench, Roy creates an interdisciplinary conversation between molecular biology, Deleuzian philosophies, science and technology studies, feminist theory, posthumanism, and postcolonial and decolonial studies. In Molecular Feminisms she brings insights from feminist and cultural theory together with lessons learned from the capabilities and techniques of bacteria, subcloning, and synthetic biology to o er tools for how we might approach nature anew. In the process she demonstrates that learning how to see the world around us is also always about learning how to encounter that world.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780295744117"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0295744111"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":283,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Social Science"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.5.4.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9HpyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9HpyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=9HpyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=molecular+feminis&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=9HpyDwAAQBAJ&dq=molecular+feminis&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Molecular_Feminisms.html?hl=&id=9HpyDwAAQBAJ","status":"To Read","rating":0},{"title":"Modern Money Theory","subtitle":"A Primer on Macroeconomics for Sovereign Monetary Systems","authors":["L.

Our earth and its skies are, for the Bush administration, the final frontiers of imperial control. In Hegemony or Survival , Noam Chomsky investigates how we came to this moment, what kind of peril we find ourselves in, and why our rulers are willing to jeopardize the future of our species. With the striking logic that is his trademark, Chomsky dissects America's quest for global supremacy, tracking the U.S. government's aggressive pursuit of policies intended to achieve \"full spectrum dominance\" at any cost. He lays out vividly how the various strands of policy-the militarization of space, the ballistic-missile defense program, unilateralism, the dismantling of international agreements, and the response to the Iraqi crisis-cohere in a drive for hegemony that ultimately threatens our survival. In our era, he argues, empire is a recipe for an earthly wasteland. Lucid, rigorous, and thoroughly documented, Hegemony or Survival promises to be Chomsky's most urgent and sweeping work in years, certain to spark widespread debate.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781429900218"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1429900210"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":324,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Political Science"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":4,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"4.13.19.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5w6QwaOxfVsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5w6QwaOxfVsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=5w6QwaOxfVsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=hegemony+or+s&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5w6QwaOxfVsC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5w6QwaOxfVsC","status":"To Read","rating":0},{"title":"Not in Our Genes","subtitle":"Biology, Ideology, and Human Nature","authors":["Richard C.

Piranesi's house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house. There is one other person in the house-a man called The Other, who visits Piranesi twice a week and asks for help with research into A Great and Secret Knowledge. But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person, and a terrible truth begins to unravel, revealing a world beyond the one Piranesi has always known. For readers of Neil Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane and fans of Madeline Miller's Circe, Piranesi introduces an astonishing new world, an infinite labyrinth, full of startling images and surreal beauty, haunted by the tides and the clouds.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781635577808"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1635577802"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":273,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.2.3.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=49YzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=49YzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=49YzEAAAQBAJ&dq=piranesi&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=49YzEAAAQBAJ&dq=piranesi&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Piranesi.html?hl=&id=49YzEAAAQBAJ","status":"To Read","rating":0},{"title":"Discourses on the First Decade of Titus Livius","authors":["Niccolò Machiavelli"],"publisher":"IndyPublish.com","publishedDate":"1883","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"OTHER","identifier":"HARVARD:32044025050071"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":522,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.9.10.0.full.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xAf_MH1PGwQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xAf_MH1PGwQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.ca/books?id=xAf_MH1PGwQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=discourses+on+l&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xAf_MH1PGwQC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xAf_MH1PGwQC","status":"To Read","rating":0}])
